      <p id="display" class="fade-in">Hi friend, &#x1F601; I'm happy you are here.<br /><br />Dao Drip &#x1F4A7; came about to assist with casual study &#x1F50E; of translations of the Daodejing &#x1F4DC; (&#x1F5E3; <span class="emphasis">"Dow Duh Jeang"</span>). This ancient philosophical text emerged &#x1F331; from a period of oral composition over the course of several centuries &#x23F3;, and has been translated hundreds of times. Each attempt to interpret &#x1F4A1; the words of the "Old Master" is a unique manifestation &#x1F441; of a common human heritage &#x1F517; that seeks to make sense of our mysteries &#x1FA9E;.<br /><br />Many people appreciate &#x1F60D; the briefness &#x1FA83; of the text, and Dao Drip attempts to celebrate &#x1F389; this accessible nature by selecting a single random &#x1F3B2; chapter (out of 81) for you to ponder &#x1F4AD;. Three characteristically distinct &#x1F9EC; translations of the random chapter are placed together &#x1F53A; so that we may more easily <span class="emphasis">begin</span> to surface &#x26CF; the fundamental wisdom within &#x1F573;. Their differences and similarities reveal &#x1FA84; both the individual's voice &#x1F58D; and the nuance of the original underlying source &#x26F2;.<br /><br />More soon on the choices and sources of translations &#x1F9E9; used here.</p>
